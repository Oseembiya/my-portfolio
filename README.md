# My Portfolio Website

![Portfolio Preview](src/assets/Desktop.png)

Welcome to my portfolio website – a dynamic showcase of my journey as a full-stack developer. Built with React and modern web technologies, this platform serves as both a professional portfolio and a testament to my technical capabilities. The site features a thoughtfully designed user interface that combines smooth animations, responsive layouts, and intuitive navigation to create an engaging user experience. Each section – from the animated hero landing page to the interactive project gallery – has been crafted to demonstrate my expertise in front-end development, while the contact form integration with EmailJS showcases my back-end knowledge.
